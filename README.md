This is the repository for my personal website. Some elements may have been excluded in the interest of privacy and security.

## Demo

https://peterchrjoergensen.dk

## Installation

### Build

Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Process and build assets.

```
npm run build
```

Images and stylesheets should be placed in their respective folders in the `resources/src` directory if they are to be processed.

### Deployment

Pull the latest changes from the `master` branch.

```
git pull origin master
```

Composer is not currently available on my hosting service, so I include the `vendor` directory.

## Development

The website is developed using Flight PHP framework, Composer PHP dependency manager, Gulp building toolkit, JQuery JavaScript library, Bootstrap front-end component library and SASS CSS extension language.

For more information on how I developed the website, please visit [my blog](https://blog.peterchrjoergensen.dk).

If you would like to contribute by filing an issue or sending a pull request, please feel free to do so.
