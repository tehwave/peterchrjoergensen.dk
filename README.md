# peterchrjoergensen.dk

My corner of the web. A place to share what I've built, what I've learned, and what I'm working on.

**Take a look:** [peterchrjoergensen.dk](https://peterchrjoergensen.dk)

## Why This Exists

I've been writing code since I was 14. Turned it into a career at 24. For most of that time, I ran a dev team at a marketing agency—shipping sites for local businesses, startups, and companies pulling in millions. PHP, Laravel, WordPress, whatever got the job done.

This site is where I showcase the work I'm proud of and write about what I've learned along the way. It's also an experiment in building something fast and simple with modern tools.

## What's Inside

Browse through [projects](https://peterchrjoergensen.dk/#projects) I've built—everything from web platforms to game jam entries. Read the [blog](https://peterchrjoergensen.dk/blog/) for thoughts on web development, performance, and occasionally game dev.

The site itself is built with [Astro](https://astro.build)—a framework that ships zero JavaScript by default and lets pages load in under a second.

Self-hosted fonts, edge deployment on Cloudflare, and images optimized at build time. *It's fast because it doesn't carry what it doesn't need.*

## Built With

- **Astro 5** — Static site generation, zero JS by default
- **TypeScript** — Type safety without the overhead
- **Sass** — Scoped component styles, design tokens
- **Cloudflare Pages** — Global edge deployment

## Installation

If you want to poke around:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## License

Code's open source. Use it to learn, reference it for your own projects. That's what it's here for. Content's mine though.
