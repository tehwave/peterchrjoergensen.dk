        I see enormous potential in artificial intelligence — while staying mindful of its
        implications. It's a technology that demands both excitement and thoughtful consideration,
        and I try to bring that balanced perspective to everything I do with it.
      </p>
      <p class="ai__text">
        Where I really love applying AI is in code generation and web development workflows. It has
        fundamentally changed how I approach building websites and applications. In fact, this very
        website was built in large part with AI assistance — from component structure to styling
        decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="ai__text">
        I've had the opportunity to give talks on AI use in businesses, and I genuinely enjoy those
        conversations. Whether it's helping teams understand practical applications or discussing
        the broader implications, AI is a topic I never tire of exploring.
