import Figure from '../../components/Figure.astro';

## The decision to start over

I rebuilt this site because the old one had expired. It was from 2021, and it no longer reflected what I'm capable of. It also didn't match what I care about: shipping less, building things that perform well, and keeping sites accessible.

The workflow had become friction. Writing a post meant juggling Markdown files, manually checking metadata, and hoping nothing broke. I was shipping JavaScript for navigation and animations that never needed to be interactive. I wanted something modern that felt right to work with. Astro gave me that.

## What was wrong with the old build

The site looked fine. Maintaining it didn't.

**Too much client JavaScript.** Navigation, animations, even simple lists hydrated by default. Debugging a layout shift meant sifting through bundles I didn't need.

**Scattered design tokens.** Colors, spacing, and typography lived in different files. Small tweaks cascaded into a weekend of regression checking.

**Publishing friction.** Drafting a post meant juggling Markdown, image handling, and manual metadata checks. Miss one field and previews broke.

**Deploy anxiety.** I handle production incidents when things break at work. I don't want that energy for a personal site.

## What the previous stack looked like

The old site was from 2021, and it was very deliberately a “proof” site. At the time I wanted the repo itself to communicate: I can ship real Laravel.

It was Laravel 5.8 with the full production setup: Nova admin for post creation, MySQL, Redis, Forge deployment scripts, Laravel Mix bundling, FPM config caching. Classic full-stack PHP. Blade + jQuery + Bootstrap for the frontend. I used PHP Parsedown to render the Markdown content I wrote, and Spatie's Laravel MediaLibrary for image handling.

That stack wasn't wrong. It showed I could build and operate a real Laravel app. But PHP moves fast. The ecosystem aged, dependencies needed updates, and the whole thing felt complex for what it did. By 2025, the intention changed. I don't need database migrations and queue workers for a portfolio. I need a fast, low-maintenance place to write and showcase projects.

## Why Astro

I didn't come to Astro through careful evaluation. I found https://justfuckinguseastro.com/, which is blunt and annoyingly correct.

The argument is simple: if you're building a content site and defaulting to an SPA, you're optimizing for developer convenience over user experience. A website should behave like a website. HTML first. JavaScript only where it earns its keep.

That aligned with something I care about: **shipping less matters for climate impact**. Smaller payloads mean less energy transferring, parsing, and executing code. It's small on one site, but defaults matter. If I'm building portfolios or content sites, I want the lightest option that works.

Once I started prototyping, Astro fit how I wanted to build:

**Zero JavaScript by default.** Anything interactive has to justify itself with a `client:` directive. That keeps the baseline honest.

**Content Collections with Zod validation.** Type-checked frontmatter means missing fields get caught at build time, not production.

**Scoped components with SASS tokens.** The design system lives in one place. Less drift, fewer surprises.

**Cloudflare Pages deployment.** I wanted to ship via Cloudflare Workers/Pages, and Astro makes that trivial. They're good friends. It couldn't have been easier.

**Image optimization out of the box.** Astro handles responsive srcsets, format conversion (AVIF, WebP), and optimization automatically. I don't think about it.

There was also a practical accelerant: AI help works well here.

Astro sits in the JavaScript ecosystem, but the output is boring (in the best way): HTML + CSS with clearly scoped components. That makes it easy to ask an AI for changes and get back something I can review quickly.

Having an Astro documentation MCP tool in my editor is a real workflow upgrade. When I'm writing a component and can query the docs directly, I stay in flow.

Learning Astro from scratch was *fun*. I'd never touched it before this project. Coming in fresh meant I questioned patterns instead of copying them. The site that came out feels like mine, not something I adapted from a template.

## How I approached the rebuild

I came into Astro completely new. I'd never touched it before this project. That meant I approached it with a learning mindset: try things, see what works, experiment.

AI helped a lot here. It was already an expert with Astro, so I could move fast without getting stuck on syntax or patterns. I'd ask, iterate, and keep building.

The blue hero card was the only thing that survived from the old design, and even that got a complete redesign with 3D perspective and parallax effects. Everything else evolved through experimentation.

The source code is on GitHub. Take a look. I welcome feedback.

## Performance after the switch

The old site had terrible Lighthouse scores. Shipping jQuery + Bootstrap for the design system meant heavy payloads and slow initial renders.

The new site is the opposite. The homepage ships minimal JavaScript. The Hero component uses client-side code for the typed role animation. Everything else is static HTML and CSS.

LCP stays under a second without hero-image gymnastics. CLS is effectively zero because nothing waits on client scripts to settle.

Lighthouse landed in the high 90s without tweaking. Better: it stays there between deploys because the baseline is static.

## Content workflow now

I love the new workflow. No database. Content lives in Markdown files in git, and Astro supports this out of the box.

**Frontmatter enforces types.** The content collection schema catches missing fields at build time. Strict adherence to structure without manual validation.

**Images stay consistent.** When I need a visual, I use the `<Figure />` component with proper alt text. Astro handles the responsive srcsets, format optimization (AVIF, WebP), and sizing automatically. I love it.

**MDX for flexibility.** I can embed components when I need them (demos, diagrams) without reaching for a full SPA.

No Nova admin. No database queries. Just files in version control. Publishing feels lightweight now.

## What I learned

Don't forget to ship basic HTML. You don't need any of the fancy stuff. Most of what we build doesn't need client-side JavaScript. It doesn't need hydration. It doesn't need a runtime.

Right tool for the right job. Astro is the right tool for content sites. It gets out of your way and lets you build what matters.

Thanks to the Astro contributors and makers for building something this good.
