I've been building websites professionally for a while now. Led a team. Shipped a lot of projects. At some point I stopped just shipping and started paying attention to *how* I work.

This is where I write about that.

## What I keep coming back to

I'm obsessed with fast websites. Not because I care about Lighthouse scores, but because waiting for a page to load feels bad. If something takes more than a second, I probably screwed up.

I care more about *why* I'm building something than what technology I use. The best projects solved real problems. The worst looked impressive in a portfolio and did nothing useful.

I use AI constantly now. Not to think for me, but to move faster while I'm thinking. The question that interests me isn't whether AI can write code. It's whether I can use it without losing the judgment that makes my work actually good.

I want to write about the stuff nobody else covers. Not beginner tutorials. Not theory. The decisions you make when you're stuck. The trade-offs at 2am when the docs don't help.

## What you'll find here

I build websites. I run [gm48](https://gm48.net), a game jam I started back in 2013. I care about craft, speed, and making things that actually matter.

I'll write about what I'm learning. Not as someone who has it figured out, but as someone figuring it out in public.

This site is built with Astro and a lot of AI help. Zero JavaScript by default. Loads in under a second. It's me practicing what I care about.
