# Welcome!

I'm excited to launch this blog where I'll share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings about web development, game development, and AI.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics:

- **Web Development**: Astro, performance optimization, and modern web technologies
- **Game Development**: Unity, game design, and interactive experiences
- **AI & Technology**: Exploring the intersection of AI and creative development

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro for this blog because it's:

1. **Fast by default** — Zero JavaScript shipped unless needed
2. **Content-focused** — Perfect for blogs and documentation
3. **Developer-friendly** — Great DX with modern tooling

Here's a simple example of how you might use TypeScript with Astro:

```typescript
const posts = ['post1', 'post2', 'post3'];
console.log(`Total posts: ${posts.length}`);
```

## Performance Matters

Performance is a core value for me. This site is built with:

- Static site generation (SSG) for instant page loads
- Optimized images with Astro's `<Image>` component
- Minimal JavaScript for maximum performance
- Excellent Core Web Vitals scores

> "The fastest website is one that loads instantly." — Every web developer ever

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and creators. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss web development, games, or AI!

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon.
