I've been building websites professionally for a while now. Led teams. Shipped a lot of websites and web applications. At some point I stopped just shipping and started paying attention to *how* I work.

This is where I write about that. Thank you for being here to see it.

## What I keep coming back to

I'm passionate about effective websites. Not because I care about Lighthouse scores, but because waiting for a page loads means something is wrong. If something takes more than few seconds, someone probably screwed up. Either in what they built, how they built it, or where they host it.

I care more about *why* I'm building something than what technology I use. The best projects solved real problems for real people. The worst looked impressive in a portfolio and did nothing useful for anyone.

I use AI constantly now. Not to think for me, but to move faster while I'm thinking. The thing that concerns me about it isn't whether AI can write code. It's whether I can use it without losing the judgment that makes my work actually good.

I want to write about the stuff nobody else covers. Not beginner tutorials. Not theory. The decisions you make when you're stuck. The trade-offs at 2am when the docs don't help.

## What you'll find here

I build digital experiences. I run [gm(48)](https://gm48.net), a game jam I took over back in 2013. I care about the craft, speed, and making things that actually matter.

I'll write about what I'm learning. Not as someone who has it figured out, but as someone figuring it out in this AI enabled world.

This site is built with Astro and a lot of AI assistance. Zero JavaScript by default. Loads in under a second. It's me practicing what I care about.
