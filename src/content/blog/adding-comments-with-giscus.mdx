I wanted comments on this site. Not because I expect a flood of discussion, but because it felt wrong to publish writing without a way for people to respond.

The usual path here is setting up a database, building moderation tools, handling spam, managing user accounts. I've done that before. I didn't want to do it again.

## Why giscus Works

[giscus](https://giscus.app) is a comments system that uses GitHub Discussions as the backend. No database. No user management. No moderation tools to build.

When someone comments on a blog post, it creates a GitHub Discussion linked to that page. People can comment directly on the site, or they can go to the repository and comment there. Either way works.

Here's why I picked it:

**No infrastructure to maintain.** GitHub handles everything. Storage, auth, spam filtering, moderation tools. I just embed a script.

**Lazy loading.** The comments don't load until you scroll near them. Zero impact on page speed.

**Familiar UI.** It looks like GitHub's native comment system because it _is_ GitHub's comment system. People recognize it. They trust it.

**Limited permissions.** The giscus app only has access to Discussions. It can't touch code, issues, or anything else in the repository.

## Alternatives to giscus

I looked at two other options before choosing giscus.

**utterances** uses GitHub Issues instead of Discussions. That works, but Issues are for tracking bugs and tasks. Using them for blog comments feels wrong. Discussions are meant for conversations.

**gitalk** also uses Issues, and it requires compiling JavaScript bundles and managing npm packages. I didn't want that complexity. giscus gives you a single script tag. That's it.

## The Setup Process

giscus has a configuration wizard at [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) that walks you through the setup. You pick your repository, choose a mapping strategy (I used pathname), set a theme, and it generates the script.

The whole setup is checkboxes and clear instructions. No guessing. No reading API docs.

I added the script to my blog post layout, updated my Content Security Policy headers to allow `giscus.app`, and shipped it.

Total time: less than 10 minutes.

## Open Source Works

This is what good open source looks like. Someone built a tool that solves a real problem, documented it clearly, and made it trivial to use.

I didn't have to compromise. I got comments without the database, moderation tools without the admin panel, user auth without the login system.

giscus just works. I recommend it.
