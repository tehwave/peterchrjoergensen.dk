## Project Overview

This is an example project page to demonstrate the MDX-based project system. When you create MDX files in `src/content/projects/`, they automatically:

1. Get their own dedicated page at `/projects/[slug]`
2. Appear as clickable cards on the homepage with an arrow icon
3. Include full SEO optimization with Open Graph and JSON-LD
4. Support hero images and rich content

## Key Features

- **Full MDX support** — Use all MDX features including components
- **SEO optimized** — Meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, structured data
- **Performance friendly** — Images optimized at build time
- **Responsive** — Beautiful on all devices

## Implementation Details

The project system merges two data sources:

1. **Simple projects** (`src/data/projects.ts`) — Display as cards with external links
2. **MDX projects** (`src/content/projects/`) — Get dedicated pages

### Code Example

```typescript
// Example of how projects are merged
const allProjects = [
  ...normalizedMdxProjects,
  ...simpleProjects.map((p) => ({ ...p, hasPage: false })),
];
```

## Results

This hybrid approach lets you:

- Keep simple projects lightweight (just frontmatter)
- Expand selected projects with full case studies
- Maintain consistent card design across both types
- Optimize for performance and SEO

## Next Steps

To create your own project page:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/content/projects/`
2. Add frontmatter with required fields
3. Write your case study content
4. Build and deploy!

The project will automatically appear on the homepage with a clickable card linking to its dedicated page.
